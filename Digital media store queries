-- Using a dataset called 'chinook', which contains information on a digital media store (tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers), let's answer some questions about the data.

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT customerId, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM chinook.customers
    WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT customerId, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM chinook.customers
    WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cus.FirstName, cus.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
    FROM chinook.invoices as inv
    LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cus
    ON inv.CustomerId = cus.CustomerId

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
    WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';
    
--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT inv.invoiceId, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName

        ON inv.CustomerId = cus.CustomerId;

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.Total, cus.FirstName, cus.LastName, cus.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName

    INNER JOIN chinook.customers as cus

--How many Invoices were there in 2009?

--What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

--Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
