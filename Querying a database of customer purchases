# Let's query a database called BIT_DB with multiple tables to learn more about customers and some of their order data. 

# 1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

# 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
  AND length(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

# 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT distinct acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers cus
  INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
  ON cus.order_id = feb.orderid
  WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

# 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)*price as revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  GROUP BY Product

# 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(Quantity), Product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
  WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

# 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT count(distinct cus.acctnum), avg(Quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cus
  ON feb.orderid=cus.order_id
  WHERE feb.Quantity>2
  AND length(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
